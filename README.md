# 🧐 About the Project

> Deciding what to have for dinners is always a struggle in our house hold, so a place to store all the recipes and ingredients that you can access from anywhere seems like a logical solucion. 
> This is my first time using react native. I'm trying to build something that would have a use in the real world. 
> This is still on the very first version, I'll be working on it as I progress in my knowledge of the language.
